# **WHAT'S IN A BOOK?!**

**"If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads" - famous words by Ralph Waldo Emerson - have always summed up my thoughts on books and reading.**

My fascination with books started with a love for collecting them. My father has always been an avid reader, and my earliest memories of childhood were mounds of books in his bedroom and office. Yet, even though I was taught to read in primary school and I excelled in both English Language and English Literature in secondary school, I never truly enjoyed or appreciated the gift of reading - the odd Grisham, Sheldon, Archer or Ludlum book aside.

I truly discovered my love for reading in my early twenties - at my most prolific, reading two books a week, whilst the internet kept me awake hours beyond my bedtime - and it is a love that has given me more wisdom, intelligence and discernment than most experiences I have encountered in my relatively short life. In the past three years, I have discovered an even greater love for books - with my tastes evolving as my interests and passions have evolved.

In returning to Nigeria from the United Kingdom, I had to sacrifice my volume of books - albeit to the benefit of the local library and the British Red Cross Shop in Staple Hill. It is a pain that is, ironically, often difficult to put into words. Over the last couple of years, as my interest in reading has picked up, I have begun re-building my book collection - a true endeavor of love, which has come with its own fair share of challenges and expenses.

My tastes have never been pretentious, and over time, I have learnt to accept that - my predilections vary depending on my mood. These days, I find myself increasingly drawn to books and websites on business, entrepreneurship, innovation, technology, leadership and strategy - which mirror my passions in life. I am, however, just as likely to spend hours on end catching up on any/all sports in general, my love-hate relationship with Arsenal FC, house music and movies.

This blog was the idea of my loving wife _(and Enabler-in-Chief)_ to riff, share some of my learnings, and try perhaps to follow in the path of the many authors I have come to enjoy and admire over time. I hope you find it meaningful.
