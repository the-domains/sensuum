# **WHAT'S IN A BOOK?!**

**"If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads" - famous words by Ralph Waldo Emerson - have always summed up my thoughts on books and reading.**

My fascination for books started with a love for collecting them. My father has always been an avid reader, and my earliest memories of childhood were mounds of books in his bedroom and office. Yet, even though I was taught to read in primary school and I excelled in both English Language and English Literature in secondary school, I never truly enjoyed or appreciated the gift of reading - the odd Grisham, Sheldon, Archer or Ludlum book aside.

I truly discovered my love for reading in my early twenties - at my most prolific, reading two books a week, whilst the internet kept me awake hours beyond my bedtime - and it is a love that has given me more wisdom, intelligence and discernment than most experiences I have encountered in my relatively short life. In the past three years, I have discovered an even greater love for books - finding myself increasingly drawn to business books, non-fiction, and even podcasts.

In returning to Nigeria from the United Kingdom, I had to sacrifice my volume of books - albeit to the benefit of the local library in Staple Hill, and more reluctantly perhaps, the British Red Cross shop in Downend. It is a pain that is, ironically, often difficult to put into words. Over the last couple of years, I have begun re-building my library - a true endeavor of love, which has come with its own fair share of challenges and resource utilization.

My tastes have never been pretentious, and over time, I have learnt to accept that I enjoy what I enjoy - and my tastes and predilections vary depending on my mood. This blog was my loving wife (and Enabler-in-Chief's) idea for me to share some of my learnings, and learn perhaps to follow in the path of so many authors whom I have come to love and admire over time. I hope it brings you some benefits.
